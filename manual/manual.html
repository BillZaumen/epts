<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>

EPTS (Edit PoinTS) is a special-purpose graphics editor. When using
the BZDev class library's <code>graphs</code> and <code>anim2d</code>
packages, there are three coordinate systems that are used:
<UL>
  <LI> the standard Java user-space coordinates, which measures
    distances in units of "points" (1/72 inches) and where the
    positive X direction points left and the positive Y direction
    points down.
  <LI> image space coordinates, in which one unit corresponds to a
    pixel. The BZDev graphs package and the anim2d package will specify
    if an image, before scaling, would be rendered so that one pixel's
    height and width correspond to one unit in either user space or
    graph coordinate space. EPTS assumes that graph coordinate space
    was chosen, and allows an appropriate scale factor to be defined.
  <LI> graph coordiante space coordinates, in which distances are
    measured in application-specific coordinates (e.g., meters) and
    where the positive X direction points left and the positive Y
    direction points up.
</UL>
EPTS will display an image and allow one to overlay this image with
points and B&eacute;zier curves, expressing their locations and control
points in graph coordinate space units. It will also allow one to measure
the distance between points in either image space or graph coordinate space
units.
